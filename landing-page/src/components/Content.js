      How can we help you?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our team has designed an improved workflow for collecting survey responses
      from the elderly. No more need for manual input! We have proposed digitized
      solutions that will  ensure that no human errors can be found. From these 
      results, we have an automated dashboard where key findings from our 
      survey results can be hosted.
